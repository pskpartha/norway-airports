## Resources

- _[1]_ https://angular.io/
- _[2]_ https://www.airlabs.co/
- _[3]_ https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/google-maps

## Problem

Business shaman came to you and said he needs a web application that lists out all the airports in Norway. Business shaman says it is also important to see next 5 departures for the airport if you chose to select it. It is up to you to make a nice design for it as Figma shaman is on sick leave.

## Requirements

1. Application must be done in Angular _[1]_
2. The data must come from Airlabs API _[2]_
3. App must have more than 1 page
4. It should look nice, use whatever component/UI library you like
5. Your code must be stored in remote Git repository.

## Bonus

1. Show the airports on the map, you can use Google Maps for it _[3]_ or something else what you know/like.
2. Selected airport should be focused on the map
3. Translations - make your app support more than 1 language
4. Write some tests for the app, test must be meaningful
5. Accessibility - high contrast, keyboard navigation etc

# NorwayAirports

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
